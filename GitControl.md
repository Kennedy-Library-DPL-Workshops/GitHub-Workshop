### IDE  

Most IDE's have git support, where you can stage, commit, and push/pull through the IDE in an easier interface than through the terminal.

Usually it looks something like this:

1. A "Source Control" or "Version Control" tab on the side or top of the IDE.
2. A text prompt to write a Commit message.
3. Modified files list, with an option to stage/unstage files.
4. A Graph showing the commits on the remote branch and the commits on the local brach (usually in different colors)
