# DPL GitHub Workshop  


## Installing Git  

To install **Git** you must locally install it to your computer:  

### Windows:  
> [Install Latest Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)  
> *Download through "Click here to download the latest (2.49.0) 64-bit version of Git for Windows"*  

### Linux:  
Type into your terminal command-line:
> $ sudo apt install git-all

### Mac:  
Type into your terminal command-line:
> $ git --version  
> *If you dont already have it installed, it will prompt you to install*

## Make a GitHub Account  

Go to [GitHub SignUp](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)  
Make sure to use your calpoly email as your email adress.

Once you've made your account. Make your first repository!

## Repository  

Go to the profile dropdown and go to "Your repositories" and make a "New" repository.

It is good practice to:
- Name your repository with purpose
    - Dont name it: *dork_destroyer* -- when your project is a chess solving bot who trashtalks his opponent.
    - Instead name it something like : *verbose-chess-opp*
- Add a description
    - Using the example above, a good description would be :
    > *A chess-playing AI bot who ridicules thier*  
    > *opponents based on the moves they make while playing.*
- Check off "Add a README.md" \*unless specified not to by professors  
    - A *README.md* file is a markdown text file that works as a place for general documentation.
    - You can add more *.md* files for more documentation on larger projects!
 
## Cloning
Now that you have a repository, you can clone it to edit your code and test in an IDE of your choice!

To clone:
1. Click on the **"< > Code"**  
2. Under **Local** and **HTTPS**, copy the link provided.  
3. In your programming IDE (*VSCode*, *PyCharm*, *IntelliJ*, *etc*)  
   1. Select clone repository and paste the link.  
   2. Select where you want the local project stored.  
  
# SUCCESS!!

### You now have a working local project where you can edit and push your changes to your github repository.  
### Now move onto how to version control with git.
