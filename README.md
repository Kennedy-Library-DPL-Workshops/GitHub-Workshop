## Installing Git  

To **install** git you must locally install it to your computer:  

### Windows:  
> [Install Latest Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)  
> *Download through "Click here to download the latest (2.49.0) 64-bit version of Git for Windows"*  

### Linux:  
> $ sudo apt install git-all

### Mac:  
> $ git --version  
> *If you dont already have it installed, it will prompt you to install*

Once you've made your account. Make your first repository!

## Repository  

Go to the profile dropdown and go to "Your repositories" and make a "New" repository.

It is good practice to:
- Name your repository with purpose
    - Dont name it: *Bingus-Khan* -- when your project is a chess solving bot who trashtalks his opponent.
    - Instead name it something like : *verbose-sudobot*
- Add a description
    - Using the example above, a good description would be :
    > *A chess-playing AI bot who ridicules thier opponents based on the moves they make while playing.*
- Check off "Add a README.md" *unless specified not to by professors*
    - A README.md file is a markdown text file that works as a place for general documentation.
    - You can add more .md files for more documentation on larger projects!
